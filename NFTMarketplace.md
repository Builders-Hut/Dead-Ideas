# Climate NFT Marketplace

It is an NFT marketplace where users can upload photographs of their surroundings especially the sky taken at their locations, accompanied by details such as time, temperature, humidity, and GPS-based location data. These images are sold as NFTs using Ethereum, allowing users to earn cryptocurrency directly into their MetaMask wallets. The initiative serves as a crowdsourced weather and climate data platform, helping improve forecasting accuracy,research and offering startups affordable access to local climate dataset.

## WHY

High-cost weather data: Startups and organizations often rely on expensive satellite-based systems for weather data, limiting accessibility.
Forecast inaccuracies: Weather predictions often lack precision due to insufficient hyper-local data across diverse locations.
Trust in user-provided data: Conventional methods rely heavily on user input, which might be prone to errors or falsification.
Unique Aspects:

Incorporating GPS metadata in NFTs.
Crowdsourcing: Encouraging widespread participation fosters a richer dataset that satellites or traditional systems cannot provide alone.
Improving on Existing Implementations:

NFTs with utility: Unlike typical NFTs focused on art or collectibles, these serve as a dual-purpose asset for artistic expression and critical climate data sharing.
Data accuracy algorithms: Advanced filtering ensures relevance and authenticity of submitted data, filtering out the risk of irrelevent submissions.

## HOW

This idea emerged from the intersection of blockchain technology and the pressing need for precise, localized climate data. By leveraging the growing popularity of NFTs, we aim to merge decentralized finance with practical utility, benefiting both individuals and organizations.Implemetation:
1.Designing the NFT marketplace using blockchain technology to handle transparent transactions and traceable ownership.
2.Incorporating APIs to capture GPS, temperature, and humidity data and maybe more during photo submission.
3.Validate, filter, and rank submissions for relevance and quality.

## Challenges Faced

1.Data authenticity and relevance
2.Taking in consideration of non tech savvy users.
3.Scaling and storage

## Good to have features

Must-Have Features:

1.Real-Time Analytics
2.Dynamic Pricing Algorithm.

Good-to-Have Features:

1.Gamification

2.Decentralized Voting: Users could vote on the validity or relevance of specific submissions, fostering community involvement.
3.Integration with IoT Sensors
4.Interoperable NFTs
