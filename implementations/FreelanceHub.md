## Why use this?

convince the people why they should give your project a try

    - We are using ai to divide a task a user wants into smaller components and recommending specialist freelancers for each small component basically making them work as a group for the project
    
    - Freelancers can already be recruited in multiple platforms but the user has to search a lot for it while our version gives a great recommendations based on the tech stack of freelancer and requirement of user using ML  

## Why we built this?

talk about what got you to building this project in the first place

    - Its very hard for freelancers to market themselves to users even though they are very skilled

## Deployment instructions

instructions on how to get your project running 

optional: live link

    So we havent completed the project wiht a running app but we have coded the scoring part based on the github username of freelancer
    and a smart contract on blockchains using web3 to mimic transactions
    and we have built a oauth 2.0 github using client id and passkey where the freelancer has to generate them from the authentication page and paste them for verification
