# CodeSwipe

CodeSwipe is a revolutionary networking platform designed exclusively for programmers, offering a refreshing alternative to traditional professional networking sites. By focusing on code over photos and emphasizing genuine connections through shared technical interests, CodeSwipe creates a casual, programmer-friendly space for finding collaborators and like-minded developers.

## Features

- Minimalist Discovery Interface: View one programmer profile at a time, allowing for meaningful consideration of potential connections
- Code-First Approach: Profiles showcase code snippets and projects instead of personal photos, putting programming skills front and center
- Simple Connection Mechanism: Intuitive left/right swipe functionality to connect with fellow developers
- Focused Profile Prompts: Streamlined profile creation with programmer-specific prompts:
    - Current tech stack and expertise
    - Favorite projects and achievements
    - Areas of interest and preferred collaborations
    - Programming goals and aspirations

## Why use this?

Unlike general professional networking platforms or social media sites, CodeSwipe offers:

- A distraction-free environment focused solely on connecting programmers
- Less formal, more authentic interactions centered around shared technical interests
- No overwhelming feed of content â€“ just one potential connection at a time
- Emphasis on actual coding abilities and interests rather than professional networking
- A casual, pressure-free way to find project collaborators, mentors, or programming friends

## Why we built this?

We noticed a gap in the developer networking landscape. While platforms like LinkedIn excel at professional networking and Twitter/Reddit provide general social interaction, there wasn't a dedicated space for programmers to connect casually with potential collaborators or friends. Traditional platforms often feel too formal or overwhelming, making it difficult to form genuine connections within the programming community. CodeSwipe aims to bridge this gap by creating a focused, programmer-friendly environment for meaningful connections.
