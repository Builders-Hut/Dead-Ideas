# <Project title>

A comprehensive database for all things music: Lyrics, Samples, Beats, and more.

## Features

1. **Search Functionality**  
   - A search bar on the homepage allows users to look up any song they want to learn about.

2. **Top 10 Songs Globally**  
   - The homepage displays a list of the top 10 globally trending songs.

3. **Personalized Top 10**  
   - Users can log in to view their personalized Top 10 songs based on their listening history.

4. **Song Details**  
   - By clicking "More Details" on a song, users can view:
     - Song image.
     - Song details including title, album, and artist information.

5. **Lyrics Display**  
   - Users can also view the lyrics of a selected song for a more immersive experience.

## Why use this?
As there aren't many websites where you can see the top 10 globally streaming songs as well as your own top 10 songs and see the details like album name, genre, artist name, album cover and lastly lyrics. Our website brings all features together providing the user with a complete user experience.
