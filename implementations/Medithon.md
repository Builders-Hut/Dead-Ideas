Refined Outline for Medithon
Core Features:
1.	Secure Medical Record Storage:
o	Implementation: 
	Use AES-256 for encrypting medical data and RSA-2048 for secure key exchange.
	Store encrypted data on a decentralized network using IPFS for reliability and privacy.
o	Progress Update: 
	Encryption and decryption of medical records with AES and RSA successfully implemented.
o	Next Steps: 
	Integrate ipfshttpclient to upload and retrieve encrypted files, ensuring seamless data handling.
2.	AI-Driven Appointment Scheduling:
o	Implementation: 
	Develop priority-based scheduling using Priority + Weighted Round Robin Algorithm.
	Use scikit-learn to train models for personalized recommendations based on user history.
o	Next Steps: 
	Implement a basic scheduling logic and test with mock patient data before integrating AI/ML features.
3.	Blockchain-Inspired Verification:
o	Implementation: 
	Use eth-hash for hash-based verification and a Merkle Tree structure for record timestamps.
	Ensure data authenticity through a lightweight blockchain-inspired approach using web3.
o	Next Steps: 
	Integrate hash verification into workflows and build a prototype for proof-of-authenticity checks.
4.	Secure Teleconsultations:
o	Implementation: 
	Implement teleconsultation using WebRTC for secure, encrypted video calls.
	Use Python libraries for end-to-end encryption of video streams and shared data.
o	Next Steps: 
	Develop a simple Flask API for initiating calls and test video stream encryption.
5.	AI-Powered Health Insights:
o	Implementation: 
	Build machine learning pipelines with TensorFlow and scikit-learn to provide personalized insights.
	Implement an interactive chatbot trained on medical data to assist users with health queries.
o	Next Steps: 
	Prototype the chatbot and train it with FAQs for common medical issues.
6.	User Experience:
o	Implementation: 
	Create a responsive UI with ReactJS to manage health data, insights, and appointments.
	Include analytics dashboards for visualizing patient progress and system recommendations.
o	Next Steps: 
	Finalize wireframes and begin integrating with Flask backend endpoints.

Workflow (Implemented and Planned):
1.	Implemented:
o	User authentication and account management using Flask and SQLAlchemy.
o	Encryption and decryption of medical records.
2.	Planned:
o	Users upload medical records → Records encrypted and stored in IPFS.
o	AI analyzes records and prioritizes appointment scheduling based on health urgency.
o	Physicians review records → Secure teleconsultation initiated for diagnosis.
o	Analytics dashboard updates based on new consultations and physician input.
________________________________________
Deployment Enhancements:
•	Backend: 
o	Flask APIs modularized for secure and scalable interactions.
o	Use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for robust database management.
•	Frontend: 
o	Develop dynamic and responsive ReactJS components for user interaction.
o	Create separate dashboards for patients and physicians to enhance usability.
•	DevOps: 
o	Containerize the application using Docker and deploy on AWS or Heroku.
o	Automate CI/CD pipelines for faster iteration cycles.
