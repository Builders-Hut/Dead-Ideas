# <SARIT>
in today's world all of us are depending on online platforms to educate us on our university/school curriculums but often while using these platforms we get distracted/lost. a solution to this idea is our SARIT app. by just choosing the topics you will be linked to multiple video and text sources

## Features

our app has both video and text lessons in addition to this to provide motication to students we have leaderboards and daily streaks too. it's entirely distraction free and will neatly categorize the necessary data

## Why use this?
instead of spending hours on the internet just to try and find the right resources for you, you could rather use our app and stay entirely productive!

## Why we built this?

this issue of getting lost in the internet trying to find lectures in your curriculum is beyond real and is at an all time high, even if students want to stay productive the apps that we use for online lectures are very addictive and entertaining too so we end up giving in to its distractions
