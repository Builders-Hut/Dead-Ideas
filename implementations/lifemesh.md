# Freelancer Ranking System

## Idea Title
Freelancer Ranking Based on Skills, Experience, and Potential USing ML&AI and BlockChain, NFT.

### Short Description
This project ranks freelancers based on their match with specific client requirements, previous experience, and their potential for future growth. It incorporates weighted factors, including skill match, task context, previous experience, and learning potential, to generate a final score that helps clients make informed decisions about hiring freelancers.

## Why

### Problems Addressed:
In the freelancing world, finding the right candidate can be overwhelming. Clients often struggle to identify freelancers with the right skillset and potential to meet their project needs. Current ranking systems are too basic and do not account for future potential or learning capability.

### Unique Aspects:
- **Potential Score:** Unlike traditional systems that focus solely on experience, this project also evaluates the freelancer's potential to grow in the role, which is crucial for long-term projects.
- **Experience vs. Newcomer Balance:** It also takes into account the freelancer's experience, where newcomers are given a slight advantage, encouraging fresh talent to step forward.

### Improvements:
While some systems rank based on basic experience and skill, this project introduces a weighted scoring system that balances immediate skills with growth potential and learning ability.

## How

### Implementation Strategy:
I thought of implementing this idea by leveraging text processing techniques to assess skill matches between freelancer profiles and client requirements. I also integrated a weighted scoring system to evaluate both current and future competencies. The focus was to create a fair ranking that doesn't just reward experience but also potential.

### Approach:
The idea was implemented using natural language processing (NLP) and text matching algorithms. A weighted formula was used to calculate scores, considering the freelancer's skills, learning potential, experience, and task context.

## Challenges Faced

### Key Challenges:
- **Data Preprocessing:** The biggest challenge was preprocessing freelancer profiles and client requirements to accurately match keywords while handling noise and irrelevant information.
- **Balancing the Weights:** Finding the right balance between the importance of skills, experience, and potential was another challenge, as it required testing different combinations to get a meaningful ranking.

## Good to Have Features

### Future Enhancements:
- **Real-Time Updates:** It would be beneficial to implement a dynamic ranking system that updates in real-time based on client feedback and project completion.
- **Skill Evolution Tracking:** Tracking the evolution of a freelancer's skill set over time could further improve the ranking by rewarding continuous learning.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** An algorithm that suggests freelancers based on client preferences and past work could be a valuable addition.
