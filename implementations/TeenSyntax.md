## Why we built this?

We created TeenSyntax because we know how overwhelming learning can feel for teenagers today. With so much content out there, it’s hard to figure out what’s important and stay motivated. We wanted to make learning simpler, faster, and a lot more fun. TeenSyntax helps teens turn their favorite videos into quick summaries and quizzes, saving time and making it easier to focus on what really matters. It’s a way to take the stress out of studying and put students in control of their learning journey. At its heart, TeenSyntax is about helping teens learn smarter, feel more confident, and enjoy the process along the way
