# <HackMatch>

HackMatch is a networking platform exclusively for programmers, focused on connecting developers based on their technical skills, projects, and shared interests.

It uses a swipe mechanism (similar to dating apps) to help programmers find collaborators or simply network with like-minded individuals.

## Features

Swipe Mechanism: Quickly swipe through profiles to find matching collaborators or friends.

Tech Stack-Based Profiles: Display preferred languages, tools, frameworks, and more.

Code-Only Profiles: No photosâ€”focus on skills, projects, and coding expertise.

GitHub Integration: Automatically fetches GitHub repositories and contributions

Chat Functionality: Connect with matches to discuss projects or collaborations.

UI/UX Design: Simple and sleek, emphasizing usability for programmers.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed for fast navigation and easy interaction.


## Why use this?

HackMatch empowers programmers to connect with like-minded individuals quickly, fostering collaborations and enriching the developer community.


## Why we built this?

Existing platforms like LinkedIn are too formal for programmers to easily discover collaborators

No platform is dedicated to programmers' needs for quick, skill-based networking.
