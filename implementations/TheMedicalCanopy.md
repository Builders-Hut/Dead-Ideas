The Medical Canopy

Imagine reddit - a platform mainly used for people to post questions and others to answer. Now how well would this work in the field of medicine. Courtesy of The Hindustan times, we found out that a 2020 study says that even though 75% of villages have at least one healthcare provider, 68% of these providers lack formal medical training, and 86% operate privately. This is not just an issue in India, but all over the world. That led us to start developing 'A Medical Canopy'. A site where doctors and patients alike can ask questions and gets answers from verified professionals - making taking care of your health one step easier.

## Features

Creation of forums for questions.

-When asked a question, get replies from verified medical professionals and other patients alike. Comments spreading false information or comments unrelated to the topic will be removed by an administrator.

## Why use this?

Healthcare is a basic human necessity which is not offered to everyone. People in rural areas and underdeveloped regions often suffer due to the lack of proper healthcare. But with the digitilisation of rural areas and the increase of technology in villages in India, The Health Canopy offers these people a chance to consult the world's best doctors for free of cost. This app could also be useful for people in cities with extremely rare illnesses to consult doctors without scheduling appointments.

## Why we built this?

Two months ago, a 75 year old man in Kerela was diagnosed with murine typhus, a rare bacterial infection transmitted through flea bites. The patient had recently traveled to Vietnam and Cambodia, and upon returning, experienced symptoms such as fatigue and body aches. This is considered the first reported case of murine typhus in the state. But if he had access to The Health Canopy, he would've been able to know what to do much earlier. This is one of the cases that motivated us to choose this project statement.

## Deployment instructions

All these modules are to be downloaded and imported:
{ useState, useEffect } from 'react'
{ useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
Link from 'next/link'
{ Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
{ Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
{ Label } from "@/components/ui/label"
{ Textarea } from "@/components/ui/textarea"
mysql from 'mysql2/promise'

To run this file, you need to have all the files in your local drive. Make a small LAN by creating a mobile hotspot and connecting multiple device into the same network. Now, change your firewall security's file and printer transfer to private and public. Make your wifi connection private too. Now run cmd on the connected computers with the code ping [ip4]. If this works, then proceed to pull the file across all the device by typing //[ip4] in all the machines to access it. Then multiple user can raise and answer question. (Would require a very stable network, we crashed this process multiple times during our run) 

## Extra information 

A Medical Canopy bridges the gap between accessible healthcare and trusted expertise by ensuring every answer comes from verified professionals. Empowering communities globally, itâ€™s your reliable partner in making informed health decisions.
