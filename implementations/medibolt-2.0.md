# MediBolt-2.0

It's a platform where users access their medical requirements with ease,from scheduling appointments to ordering medicines along with timely reminders.

## Why

    - An average person spends around 45mins to 1hour 15mins in long hospital queues waiting for appointments, ordering medicines, causing health issues to get aggrevated in the mean-wait time. This pertains to a serious issue that lies within most health organizations and hospitals in India. This loss of critical-time can also cause loss of death at some cases. People are often forgetful of popping their medicines in a timely and routine manner, in their busy schedules of the day. This causes abnormal biological shifts for how the body reacts when sick.
    - Even in today's world, there exists several government hospitals that haven't yet entirely gone through the shift to be entirely digital from a database that originally was stored on paper. Even the high-end expensive private hospitals like Manipals' have some of these features mentioned before on their app/website, limited to their organization. We're trying to create a centralised platform that makes it possible for a seamless transition of any hospital to their digital counterpart. 
    - We've improved on the UI/UX interface of existing platforms that include some of these features, to include more of buttons and images than text. WE've made the interface more interactive than existing government websites.

## How 

talk about 
    - We looked at it with a personal-angle. We've all been victims to this wastage of integral-time, and we believe in no compromise when it comes to one's health. The last thing we could want for anyone is to lose their life due to such a reason.
    note: try to be vague so as to leave room for interpretation

## Challenges Faced

    - Thinking of a solution to this, it was important for us to understand individual parameters that's integral for the data to be added into the database, in regard to medical-records and medicinal information.
    We had to individually recognize certain diseases or symptoms that are commonly diagnosed to train a chatbot, thus reducing the diagnosis time spent by the doctors.

## Good to have features

    - Integration with the Medical-Insurance Companies for them to quickly run through a patient's mediccal history and verify it across records before providing then with Medical Insurance.
