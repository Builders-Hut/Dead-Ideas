## Extra information 
The app aims to mainly help the elderly and terminally ill patients to keep a track of their medical histories, as they're prone to forgetting/losing data due to the sheer amount of work it takes to physically 
maintain such records. It becomes increasingly hard for them if have no support system and our apps ensures that the patients and doctors have a smoother hospital process.
