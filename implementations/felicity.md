This is the project of team printc

Project Name : Felicity
Project Topic : Task overflow + Sentimental Analysis

The project is a website that is a combination of the task flow and sentimental analysis project model. 
It lets employers match with freelancers that align with their requirements while also providing freelancers with an oppurtunity for jobs with transparent and secure exchanges.

FEATURES:
1. Sentiment Analysis model to provide detailed feedback to the freelancers from their employers.
2. Easy user interface for convenient platform navigation.
3. Efficient machine learning models to connect employers with suitable freelancers.

WHY USE THIS?
This platform would provide an amazing opportunity to hire freelancers for work that is catered to you and on the flip case, you are a freelancer, it matches you to employers that would use your skills properly.
Employers struggle with finding the right clients and vice-versa freelancers with finding jobs that fit their skill set.
This idea bridges the gap between an employer and freelancer to improve hiring efficiency while also providing feedback on the quality of work which ensures continuous improvement and advancement.

Why we built this?
We built this to fix the gap between organisations and freelancers when it comes to hiring. It provides a user friendly interface that improves the oppurtunities freelancers receive as well as catering to the employer's requests and expectations.

TASK FLOW + SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS

Task Flow is a decentralised platform that matches a freelancer to an employer according to their requiremnets for the task and the frelancer's skillset.
The employers post a task with the associated payouts and prerequisites which are matched to a freelancer using a ML match-making algorithm. 
Sentimental Analysis is a platform that analyses the sentiment behind a product's reviews. 
It helps a business to understand customer preferences and sentiments to derive useful insights to review data. Combining Task Flow with the product review features of Sentimental Analysis, we create a multifaceted platform that allows freelancers to understand an employer's requirements for a task-
which lets the freelancer gain insights on how to improve their service furthering the freelancer's own skills.

How
We thought of implementing the idea by using an open source code from github and further developing it by adding improved features and the sentimental analysis element as well.

Challenges Faced
We initially struggled to run the github source code due to programming technicalities but later sorted it out. 
It was also extremely diffcult to incorporate block chain and ML for matching.

Good to have features
We would like to see better user friendly interface for the platform to make it easier to navigate for anybody who wants to use it. 
Statistical reports to help better assess the freelancers and their skills. 
An efficient AI that inputs your skills and details and auto makes a resume and sends it to the respective employers.
